# PIN'D
For Android Phones

A revolutionary app that can tell the average user where, when, and what the current hang out places are. The "map tab" can show you events currently (or in the future) happening and the precise location of where it is. The "pin'd" location can be tapped on and will show a detailed page of that event. The "event tab" can show all those events too, but in a list. Tapping on one of those events should show a more detailed view of that specific event.
